Over the past 100 years to the Kyoto College of Industry and Kyoto
College of Textile Fibers, KIT has progressed with the times. Set 
in the ancient capital, the source of the traditional culture, Kyoto
Institute of Technology (KIT) has established a unique academic 
culture seeking wisdom, beauty and technology. KIT has produced 
a vast pool of human talent who make academic, artistic, cultural 
and industrial contributions. KIT will respond to the duties entrusted 
to us by society as a National University Corporation with independent 
and autonomous management of the university, and therefore hereby 
declare the following philosophy.

KIT will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of 
the science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT. Based on 
the creative thinking of the researchers, through a quest for beauty 
that calls out for deeply-felt emotion and the creation of brilliant 
knowledge, KIT will create academic wisdom and art, which will lay 
the bridge to the future of human society.
